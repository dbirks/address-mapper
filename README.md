# Address Mapper

This project contains a React front end (`ui/`) and a FastAPI back end (`api/`) used to extract addresses from uploaded images.

## Running the API

```bash
cd api
python main.py
```

Once running, navigate to `http://localhost:8000/docs` to see the interactive Swagger UI generated by FastAPI.

Environment variables are loaded from `.env`. See `.env.example` for the required values.

## Running the UI

The front end lives in `ui/` and is built with Vite and pnpm.

```bash
cd ui
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The development server will start on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
To create a production build run:

```bash
pnpm build
```

The output is written to `ui/dist/`.
