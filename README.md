# Address Mapper

This project contains a React front end (`ui/`) and a FastAPI back end (`api/`) used to extract addresses from uploaded images.

## Running the API

```bash
cd api
python main.py
```

Once running, navigate to `http://localhost:8000/docs` to see the interactive Swagger UI generated by FastAPI.

Environment variables are loaded from `.env`. See `.env.example` for the required values.
